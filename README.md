# About
**Relative Growth** enables you to see the performance of any stock relative to any benchmark stock (such as index funds like VOO, QQQ).

## Why this tool?
- Helps you see if a stock or ETF has truly outgrown market benchmarks or if it has simply followed the same growth as the broader market.
- While there are tools to show overlaid charts of multiple stocks to compare performance, they fail to show how relative prices have fluctuated and don't reveal patterns where a stock may seem to be rising but is actually trailing the broader market indexes.


Feedback or suggestions are welcome.
