# About
**Beat the Index** enables you to see the performance of any stock relative to any benchmark stock (such index funds like VOO, QQQ).

**Live App:** [lokeshyadav5797.github.io/beat-the-index](https://lokeshyadav5797.github.io/beat-the-index/)

## Why this tool?
- Helps you see if a stock or ETF has truly "beaten the index" or it has simply followed the same growth as the broader market.
- While there are tools to show overlaid charts of multiple stocks to compare performance, they fail to show how relative price has fluctuated and don't reveal pattern where stock may seem to be rising but actually trailing behind the broader market indexes.


Feedback or suggestions welcome.
